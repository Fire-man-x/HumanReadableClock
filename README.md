# FuzzyClock

A human-readable clock for the gnome-shell panel that indicates the nearest five minute increments within the hour and splits months into five periods: beginning, early, middle, late and end.

# Installation

```
cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
git clone https://gitlab.com/theodore.goetz/FuzzyClock.git FuzzyClock@theodoregoetz
```

Enable or disable the fuzzy clock [via the browser](https://extensions.gnome.org/local/). You may need to change the `shell-version` field in `metadata.json`. The major version number you are running can be obtained by running `gnome-shell --version`.
